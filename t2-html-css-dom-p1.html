            <h5>HTML, CSS and the DOM... For Dummies... </h5>

            <p>The guys at Udacity descibed it well,
            Think of a house - you need to build the frame and the walls in order to live inside it. Thats HTML - Its the structure and the frame of the house.
            CSS is the Styling, its the colors on the walls, the type of curtains you choose. Its what makes the flavour.
            DOM... Well this is like the storage units inside the house. The Draw that holds the cutlery. The can that holds the paint. Its the way in which you can access the information about the house.

            That's it a bit of a far off analogy but...

            <h5>What is boxifying? </h5><p>
            Boxifying is not about getting in the boxing ring with a website designer...</p>
            Boxifying is about looking at your potential layout and breaking it down in boxes - You would usually begin with the larger sections of your page first and break it down into smaller and smaller segments.
            Each section of your content can fit into a box... even if its a circle!

            <h5>What is the Box Model?</h5>
            <p>The box model or CSS Box Model defines the HTML and refers to design and layout elements.
            The box model will define margins, borders, padding, the content and line weight.</p>
