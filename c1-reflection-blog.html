          <h5>My Take on EDA</h5>
          <p>So the first week is rolling along and after a total freakout on Tuesday (day 1). I now feel like I have a handle on what we are doing and what EDA's intent is with training Nikau </p>

          <h5>My Impressions</h5>

          <p>
          There is definately a sense of care and appreciation for the students and a feeling that the course has been designed to assist us with deep learning
          </p>

         <h5>Engagement</h5>
          <p>What is my engagement? Im not sure yet? It's hard to say if I see myself sitting in front of a computer everyday coding? Im a tall guy and I pretty fidgety if I dont run around a lot, however... The idea of creating the software and products I envision for myself and others is a pretty damn good motivator...
          </p>

          <h5>Changed expectations of EDA </h5>
          <p>Yes in some ways, I didnt have many to begin with, what interested me was the consideration for empathy. Im not a competitive person and not interested in being the Alpha male (anymore).
          It seems that EDA has a similar ethos and so far that is coming through well.
          This probably needs more time to make a fair assesment...
          </p>

          <h5> Excitement and Nerves</h5>
          <p>
          Yup and Yup - Im excited because new ideas, new people and new experiences can only be good, im excited because im working towards my dreams and that has been on hold for while, but while I figure out what direction to take.<p>
          Im Nervous because im happy to work hard... But not too hard. My last tertiary studies were so intense that I couldnt work in the industry afterwards, so as long as Im not pulling all nighters and I can have a decent weekend im happy.
          </P>
