            <h5>Minfulness / Awareness relationship</h5>
              <p>What I took from this concept is that by practicing mindfullness we begin to become more aware of ourselves - We can practice focusing on "How I am feeling?", "What is this emotion I am having right now?" and perhaps something like "Is there something I can do about this emotion?".

              In practicing this we begin to add deeper clarity and insight into our inner lives and experience and to make better desicions.</p>

              <h5>Try a technique or practice</h5>
              <p>This week I have tried the Body Scan technique, or should I say I have focused more on this as I use an array of these techniques on a semi regular basis.

              The body scan technique has helped me to feel more relaxed and reduce my anxiety, especially as the work load has increased in the last two weeks.</p>

              <h5>My EMotions Are Not me</h5>
              <p>This has been good to hear, even though I have heard about this concept in the last its been a good refresher.

              Its been helpful to remind me that whilst its important to be aware of your emotions we dont have to react to them.
              We do not own our emotions, nor do they own us.

              We are able to be in control on how we act when an emotion arises.</p>
