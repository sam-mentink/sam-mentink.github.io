            <h5>Process Over Product</h5>
              <p>This was helpful, as I wasnt so worried about making a super nice website and could focus on 'deep' learning or really trying to understand the concept.
              Which I think is being achieved - not everything works so far but I have endevoured to really try and grasp the concepts - Its also more fun as im not so worried about whether the website will look slick.</p>

            <h5>Search Inside Yourself</h5>
              <p>Meditation is something ive practiced on and off for a number of yours now, beyween mindfulness, meditation and yoga I have slowly developed my own practice.
              Im really happy this is a component of the course and is a reason I chose to come to EDA, because there is a consideration of personal well being, something that was sorely missed in my last studies.
              </p>
            <h5>New Things</h5>
              <p>Probably the newest thing is connecting mindfulness with work and working relationships - I Have always thought of meditation as something you do for yourself when you get home to de stress and de fragment from the tough day at the office... So to speak, how ever allowing mental well being to come into all parts of your life is great, it creates room for balance and happiness and success and also changes the concept of work from something hard and 'not fun' to something enjoyable</p>
            <h5>Suggested Techniques</h5>
              <p>The idea of lifting the weight - Allowing your attention to slip and bringing it back again, this was a great analogy with lifting weights, illustrating what mediation is about was very helpful.</p>

            <h5>Other Musings</h5>
              <p>Really enjoying the holistic approach set up in this course and, while there is a large work load, there is enough time to meditate, go to the gym and have time for myself which reduces stress and give a good work life balance.</p>
