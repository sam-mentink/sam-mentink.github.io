            <h5>Getting Blocked on a simple problem... And solved a problem...</h5>
              <p>I was pretty stuck, this week on the last challenge 5.4 Event driven DOM modification.

              I had coded as much as I could understand, and then had run over the problem three times - This is my usual number of checks I do before looking to go to someone else.

              From there I took a break and made myself a cup of tea. I found this to be helpful in destressing.

              From there I took the code to the Slack channel where Rich proceeded to help work through the challenge with me which was really helpful.

              there were two main factors where my code was incorrect.

              From there I erwin jumped on, who had complted this challenge. He went through with me and checked the code.

              What was cool to see was that much of my code was in the right place and while the exact syntax was incorrect for some factors there was some kind of code in the right place suggesting I was forfilling the steps.

              Erwin was really cool to go through the code with me and we have now checked it all, unfortunately the very final step still doesnt work but we are almost there.

              I will ask rich to check it out and see if we can nail this last segment. So far it seems like there would only be one or two very small corrections to complte it.</p>

              <h5>Problem Solving Techniques</h5>
              <p>How confident am I on the following?

Pseudocode - Definately getting better
 Trying something - Yes I am doing this regularly
 Rubber ducky method - Havent really done this as such yet...
 Reading error messages - Beginning to understand this more now
 Console.logging - Only just discovered this really.
 Googling - yes this is a common approach for me. Usually Code ?Pseudocode - Google. Pause. Make a cup of tea.
 Asking your peers for help - I will do this but only after Ive tried other options forst.
 Asking coaches for help - not really
 Improving your process with reflection - Could improve on this. At the moment the work load is quite high, im only getting through the work and dont have time to reflect.

              </p>

              <h5>What do the following do...?</h5>
              <p>.map() - This is a mthod. It creates a new array with results from a function on all the elements withing the array. TBH - I dont understand this yet.
              </p>
              <p>.reduce() - Method. Applies a function against an accumulator and the array values to reduce to a lowest value.
              Again, i dont understand these concepts yet but I am researching them. </p>

              <p>.filter() - Method. Creates new array once the elements have passed a test set about by the function.</p>
