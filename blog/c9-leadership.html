        <h5>Compassionate Leadership</h5>
          <p>I founf this section really insightful, both as a person that may lead in the future and also in thinking about what it might be like for someone leading - and to be compassionate to thier leadership.

          <h5>Goodness Meditation</h5>
            <p>It was a really nice way to become more aware of myself and remind myself that there is goodness in me and in all things.</p>

          <h5>SCARF</h5>
          <p>It is a great way to be aware of interacting with others and creating a positive environment that will be condusive to learing.</p>

          <h5>Other Musings</h5>
          <p>Really excited about Phase 0, whilst a little nervous - the imposter syndrime has been good to cover as i think this is a massive factor for a lot of people as they embark on new journeys.
          I know for myself coding is something i thought i could never do and has been difficult to change my perspective on.
          The Search Inside Yourself component has been great in reducing some of this concern and build focus.</p>

          <p>I havent had a chance to do the Tonglen meditation yet or have a difficult conversation - How ever when pairing we had an honest conversation to each other sharing what could have been better and what worked well which was a positive experience and we both appreciated the honestly.</p>
