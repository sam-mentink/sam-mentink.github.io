<h1>What learnings did I take from the chapter?</h1>
<p>The information put across in the book and the video (ive read the first couple of chapters and decided to watch the video today too) are really cool and connect with other sources describing emotional intelligence such as Eckhart Tolle.
One of the main points put across is the idea that EI can be learned, its not some innate concept that you have or you don't, but rather something that can be developed.
the benifits of which help with deeper awareness, decision making, overall happiness, concentration and relationships.

EI can be defined as the ability to monitor your emotional state and act accordingly. What I like the idea of is being able to feel your emotions as they arise and have the choice as to how to act... Rather than react.</p>

<h1>Two minutes of mindfulness</h1>
<p>I have practiced mindfulness off and on for a while - How ever recently I have slipped in my practice.
Having Mindfulness come up with Dev Academy is a welcome reintroduction, so to speak.
So yes good, I think one of the most notable observations was my awareness of my space. Suddenly noticing the room I am in, what is on my desk, almost as if i didnt see it before or had forgotten.</p>
