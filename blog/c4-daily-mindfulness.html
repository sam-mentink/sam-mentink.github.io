            <h5>Minfulness Conversation</h5>
            <p>I have heard about this kind of conversation technique before.
            It is a great way to create an open and thoughtful connection during coversation ebcause you are confirming what the other person has sid to you before moving ahead with your next part of the conversation.

            Do I practice this myself, well I have in the past but as most of us do we slip or forget. So again having this mindfulness component as part of the EDA syllabus is great, it enables me to spark up some of those practices that I havent for a while.

            <h5>Three Techniques</h5>
            <p>I am aware of all of them, how ever meditation curcuit training is the one suggestion I am not so aware of and in the previous weeks I have liked talking about focusing and losing attention...and then bringing it back again as the training of mindfulness - So IU think I will focus on Meditation Crcuit Training this week.</p>

            <h5>Any Other Musings...?</h5>
            <p>Yeah, this week it has been more difficult to concentrate, Im not sure why as yet, how ever having the holiday on monday, perhaps knocked my routine out a little. Having the meditation and mindfulness helps to bring that attention back, especially as its part of the course it creates an acceptance of the practice which is great.</p>
