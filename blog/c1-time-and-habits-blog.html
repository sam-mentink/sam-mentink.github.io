    <h1>Reflections of <em>Time</em></h1>
    <h3>18 May 2016</h3>
    
    <p>
      <em>Time box and habits</em> <<p></p>
    </p> Whilst I haven's specifically tried many of the sauggested techniques, I have for a while looked to become more efficient and effective. 
    So I found reading and watching most of these great!
    I probably found the suggestion of creating results to be more confident particularly eye opening.<<p></p>
    Plus the 7 counter intuitive ways to be insanely productive.<<p></p>
    So have I tried any of them, well not yet but I will... 
    <p>
      <em>Interesting?... above...</em> <p></p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>What worked?</em> <p></p> Watch this space
    </p>
    <em>Further experiements</em> <p></p>
    Probably the Pomodoro approach, as I already have my own sort of approach of 50 minutes of every hour, so I'l look to break this down...<p>
    Plus Il be keeping all of this in mind as i move foward and continue building my own routine and approach, usually, ive noticed, there will be little reminders that will jog me to something i've read and i will try to implement this at that stage.
    </p>
